    "The past decade has seen a rapid development of practical applications of blockhain technology that have revolutionized internet commerce [1]. The financial industry (population) is seen as the primary user of the technology behind the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, an open source, peer-to-peer and decentralized payment system [2, 3] that has a market capitalization of over \\\\$700 billion, more valuable than brands like Walmart, Toyota, and TD Bank combined. As of February 2022, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization is \\\\$1.72T. [4] In a short period of time, the technology has demonstrated a huge potential for impacting a variety of industries beyond the financial industry, where trust, and transparency are essential."
