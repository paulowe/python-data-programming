# Personalized news recommendation using Distance matrix implementation

The distance matrix is useful in the Word2Vec algorithm. This algorithm is an example of how we can preserve semantic similarity in words.
Given a corpus of news items/articles, we can run this algorithm to perform topic detection and automatically discover the topics in those articles and find the trends
of each topic over time.

Furthermore, we can develop personalized, content-based recommendation system.
Based on the topics we discovered
from the collection of news items, and from
the history of the online reader, we can
make recommendations of news articles to the online user.
